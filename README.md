#### Notes & Quotes (that I repeatedly stick to my uncomplete & unperfect brain)

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”
― Martin Fowler 

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
― Harold Abelson

“What's the point of a program/app if it's too fragile to be developed further and be broken in near future?”
― Me

“What's the point of your code if you write the UI logic alongside with the business logic on the same file? (if you only care about UI, you can be UI/UX designer instead then)”
― Me

alas, just want to share this book to anyone (it has good beneficial philosophies that you can apply in software development/especially if you are working under a team): https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/
