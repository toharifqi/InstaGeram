InstaGeram is an instagram parody app. It has similar basic features with Instagram. This app was created during my free time, feel free to explore an fork the repo 😉

#### Stuffs I implemented in this app
- Clean architecture (without usecases this time)
- Dependency injection (dagger 2)

- Animation (Motion animation & shared element)
- Google Map API
- Unit Test (JUnit, Mockito)

#### Notes & Quotes (that I repeatedly feed to my uncomplete & unperfect brain)

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”<br>
― Martin Fowler

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”<br>
― Harold Abelson

“What's the point of a program/app if it's too fragile to be developed further and be broken in near future?”<br>
― Me

“What's the point of your code if you write the UI logic alongside with the business logic on the same file? (if you only care about UI, you can be UI/UX designer instead then)”<br>
― Me

alas, just want to share this book to anyone (it has good beneficial philosophies that you can apply in software development/especially if you are working under a team): https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/
